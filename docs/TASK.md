# Task: Mobile responsiveness fixes

## 1. Segmented tabs line breaks on mobile
The new content-type segmented control (`web/components/feed/filter-bar.tsx`,
`SegmentedTabs`) overflows / wraps awkwardly on small screens.

**Wanted:** on small screens, render the tabs as separate tab buttons (stacked
or wrapped individual buttons) instead of one continuous segmented line.

## 2. Tag creation modal not responsive
The create-tag modal (`web/components/TagPicker.tsx`, `CreateTagModal`) does not
adapt to small screens — the Name/Meaning row and the 9-column color grid don't
fit well on narrow viewports.

**Wanted:** make the create-tag form responsive (stack fields, reflow the color
grid) for small screens.
