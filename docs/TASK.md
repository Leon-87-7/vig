# vig — Feature ideation & task briefs

Canonical home for feature ideas, from one-line spark to grill-ready brief.

**How this file works**

1. **Dump** raw one-line ideas under `## Inbox` below — no structure needed.
2. Run **`/pre-grill`** — it grounds each one-liner in the real code, fattens it
   into a technical brief (Context · Wanted · Scope · Open questions), moves it
   into `## Briefs`, and clears it from the Inbox.
3. **Grill** the briefed tasks (`/grill-with-docs`, `/grill-with-search-docs`,
   or `/grilling`) to resolve the Open questions, then `/to-issue-kanban` or
   `/spec-to-kanban`.

Status markers on a brief: `✅ DONE` · `✅ ISSUED #NNN`. `/pre-grill` never
fattens a marked task. Once marked, `/pre-grill --mark-a`/`--archive` moves
its body to `docs/archive/TASK-archive.md`, leaving the title behind here.

---

## Inbox

_Raw one-line ideas go here. `/pre-grill` consumes them._

<!-- - e.g. the feed should have a saved-filters dropdown -->
 - i need a way to manage the email approval system, some kind of a CRM it should be small without overhead and i don't want to build it from scratch. also this should be a system where i call send emails to customers and resive them there (maybe i need a new email address under leondev.xyz)

## Briefs

## 1. Segmented tabs line breaks on mobile ✅ DONE

## 2. Tag creation modal not responsive ✅ DONE

## 3. Extracted-links table in the Brain page ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #238

## 4. Dashboard URL submission — a second ingest surface

> **Grilled together with task 9** on 2026-07-04. Both add a new caller of the
> shared job-creation core: task 4 from the web surface, task 9 from the
> post-enrichment repo follow-up. See ADR-0032 (dashboard supersedes
> read-mostly) and ADR-0033 (shared core shape) in `docs/adr/`.

Today URLs only enter through the Telegram webhook
(`src/telegram/webhook.py`). PRODUCT.md calls for the operator to drive the
pipeline from the dashboard too ("submitting URLs, triggering and re-running
jobs … without leaving the dashboard"). This was previously deferred (see
CONTEXT.md `Web dashboard` entry) — now unblocked by an upcoming conference
demo + parity with the Doc Parser page, and treated as a permanent capability,
not a demo-scoped exception.

**Wanted:** let the operator submit a URL from the web UI and get the same job
the Telegram path produces — including the per-template behavior exposed by the
slash commands (`/method`, `/review`, `/technical`, `/narrative`, `/summary`,
and `/freestyle`).

**Backend**

- Add `POST /api/jobs` (in `src/api/jobs.py`) that classifies the URL with
  `detect_pipeline()` (`src/utils/validators.py`) and calls the shared
  `create_and_enqueue_job` core (new `src/services/jobs.py`, ADR-0033) —
  same function the webhook and task 9's repo follow-up use.
- `chat_id` comes from `request.state.user["id"]` (the session's tenant),
  identical to every other `/api/jobs/*` endpoint. No `OPERATOR_CHAT_ID`
  interaction — that gate governs Drive/Sheets export writes only (ADR-0030),
  not job creation.
- Templates come from `PROMPT_TEMPLATES` (`src/templates.py`); accept an optional
  `template` field, including `freestyle` (custom prompt — in scope for v1).
  Reject `rejected`/unsupported URLs with the same semantics the bot uses.
- Pipelines: `short`/`long`/`article`/`repo` on day one. `document` stays on
  its own Doc Parser page (`/doc-parser`, `/api/parsed/*`) — not folded in.

**UI**

- Add a submit control to the Feed page (`web/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`): a URL
  input plus a template selector mirroring the slash commands (incl.
  Freestyle). Follow DESIGN.md tokens (signal orange on the submit action
  only). Insert an optimistic placeholder row on submit, reconciled with the
  real `job_id` once `POST /api/jobs` resolves.

## 5. Reconcile the export-isolation PRs (#207, #208) before building on them ✅ DONE

## 6. Make the web app an installable PWA

Scope is the `web/` Next.js app (app router).

**Wanted:** the dashboard is installable and has an offline app shell.

- Add a web app manifest (name, maskable icons, `theme_color`/`background_color`
  from DESIGN.md `#0b0c0f` + signal, `display: standalone`) and wire it via
  `web/app/layout.tsx` metadata.
- Add a service worker for installability + offline shell: precache the static
  shell/assets, network-first for `/api/*` so live data isn't served stale.
- Provide the required icon set (incl. maskable).

**Open questions**

- Offline scope: installable shell only, or also cache last Feed/Brain payloads
  for offline read?
- Hand-rolled SW vs. a dependency (`next-pwa`/Workbox) — prefer the minimum that
  makes it installable.
- Are web push notifications in scope, or explicitly out for now?

## 7. Better navigation for the Brain "Links" table ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #306

## 8. Controls UI on the Brain search graph

`web/components/brain-graph.tsx` renders `react-force-graph-2d` from
`/api/brain/graph`, highlighting search matches in signal orange. There are no
user-facing controls today (no zoom, recenter, or filtering).

**Wanted:** an on-canvas controls overlay for navigating the graph.

- Zoom in/out, zoom-to-fit, and recenter via the ForceGraph ref methods
  (`zoom()`, `zoomToFit()`, `centerAt()` — source cached at the
  `react-force-graph-2d` opensrc path in CLAUDE.md).
- Consider a topic legend/filter (toggle topics on/off) and focus-on-match
  (center + zoom the matched node when a search runs).
- Ghost-style controls, signal orange only on the active control; honor
  `prefers-reduced-motion`; DESIGN.md tokens.

**Open questions**

- v1 scope: zoom/fit/recenter only, or also topic filtering and
  node-detail-on-click?
- Touch/mobile gestures alongside buttons?
- Is a fullscreen/expand mode wanted?

## 9. Offer extracted GitHub repos as a follow-up repo analysis

> **Grilled together with task 4** on 2026-07-04. This is a third caller of the
> shared job-creation core (alongside the Telegram webhook and task 4's web
> surface). See ADR-0033 in `docs/adr/` and the CONTEXT.md `Repo follow-up`
> entry for the resolved shape.

When a short-form video finishes, enrichment (`src/processors/enrichment.py`,
`enrich`) returns `tools_raw` — a list of `{name, type, url, description}` where
`type` can be `"repo"`. Today those repo URLs are surfaced in the result text
only; nothing offers to analyze them. The repo pipeline already exists end to
end: `detect_pipeline()` (`src/utils/validators.py`) classifies
`github.com/{org}/{repo}` as `"repo"`, and `_route_repo` /
`_enqueue_simple_job` (`src/telegram/webhook.py`) create + enqueue a `"repo"`
job processed by `enrich_repo` (`src/services/github.py`).

**Wanted:** after a short video is processed, if its enrichment yielded one or
more GitHub repos, the bot prompts the operator to pick which repo(s) to analyze
next, and enqueues a repo job for each chosen one. Ships for all three
non-document text/URL-derived pipelines: short, article, and long-video —
three trigger sites feeding the same offer + enqueue mechanism.

**Backend**

- **Trigger sites** (data shape differs per pipeline):
  - Short (`processors/short_video.py`): candidates from `enrichment.tools_raw`.
  - Article (`processors/article.py`): candidates from its own Gemini `tools` list.
  - Long-video (`processors/long_video.py`): candidates from
    `extract_description_links` + `enrich_github_links` output (not a Gemini
    tools list — a different mechanism, same repo-offer outcome).
- **Candidate filter:** any candidate entry whose `url` resolves to `"repo"`
  via `detect_pipeline()` — not Gemini's own `type` label (which can mislabel
  a repo as `"library"`).
- **Dedupe + cap:** dedupe by `normalize_repo_url`, cap at 5 buttons (matches
  the template-picker keyboard's precedent).
- **Selection UX:** one tap = enqueue that repo immediately (no toggle/confirm
  step — avoids needing new `editMessageReplyMarkup` plumbing this codebase
  doesn't have yet). Present via `send_inline_keyboard` +
  `CallbackCtx`/`_handle_callback`/`answer_callback_query` (all in
  `src/telegram/webhook.py` + `sender.py` — see CONTEXT.md `Webhook dispatch
  table`, there is no separate `dispatch.py`/`callbacks.py`).
- **Callback encoding:** `repo_pick:{job_id}:{idx}`, indexing into a short-TTL
  Redis-cached candidate list keyed by the source `job_id` — stays well under
  Telegram's 64-byte `callback_data` limit and fits `CallbackCtx`'s existing
  single-payload-after-`:` convention.
- On selection, **reuse, don't fork**: route the chosen URL through the same
  `create_and_enqueue_job` core task 4 extracts (`src/services/jobs.py`,
  ADR-0033), which already owns the `find_recent_job_by_url` dedup check — an
  already-analyzed repo isn't re-queued for free.
- The spawned repo job inherits the same `chat_id` as the source job.

## 10. Char-count truncation for the links-table description (ui/ux) ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #305

## 11. Tags should follow the URL, not the job (many-to-many)

Tags today attach to **jobs**: the `job_tags` join table
(`src/database.py:205`, `job_id ↔ tag_id`, issue #88 / S5) keyed off a single job,
with the `tags` vocabulary in the `tags` table (`src/database.py:171`, issue #87).
The links table (`src/brain.py`, `ingest_links` / the `links` table at
`src/database.py:151`) is already deduplicated by canonical `url` — one row per
unique URL — and the same URL can surface across many jobs. So a tag pinned to a
job can't express "this URL is ui/ux" once that URL recurs in other jobs.

**Wanted:** model tags as following the canonical URL (many-to-many URL ↔ tag),
independent of how many jobs a URL appears in.

**Data**

- A URL appears in many jobs and a job extracts many URLs (many-to-many);
  `links.url` is the stable key. Tagging at the URL level needs a `link_tags`
  (`url`/`link_id ↔ tag_id`) join rather than overloading `job_tags`.
- **Reuse, don't fork:** the `tags` vocabulary table and `TagPicker`
  (`web/components/TagPicker.tsx`) already exist — reuse the vocabulary; only the
  _attachment_ target changes from job to URL.

**Open questions** (resolve in grill)

- Does this **replace** job-level tagging (`job_tags`) or coexist with it? If both,
  what's the relationship when a job's tag and its URL's tag disagree?
- Key the join on `links.id` or on canonical `url`? (Dedup canonicalization rules
  here echo task 3's open question — same canonical form must be used.)
- Surface/edit URL tags where: the Brain Links table (new column / `TagPicker`
  inline), the existing controls page, or both?
- Migration: do existing `job_tags` rows get projected onto their URLs, or do URL
  tags start empty?

## 12. Repalette: new signal orange + dark plate tokens

The design tokens have a single source: `web/tailwind.config.ts` defines
`signal.DEFAULT: '#f6921e'` plus the cool plate ladder `canvas: '#0b0c0f'` →
`surface: '#14161a'` → `raised: '#1c1f25'` (`tailwind.config.ts:12-27`). The same
values are normative in `DESIGN.md`'s frontmatter, and the ~39 `web/` consumers
use Tailwind classes (`bg-signal`, `text-signal`, `bg-canvas`…), so they inherit
the change without edits. `DESIGN.md` also pins a derived signal ramp:
`signal-bright #ffa83d`, `signal-deep #b96a06`, `onsignal #16100a`.

**Wanted:** the signal color becomes `#FFBE0B` and "the dark color" becomes
`#2A2312`, applied at the token source so the whole console repalettes.

**UI / Design tokens**

- Update `web/tailwind.config.ts` and mirror into `DESIGN.md`'s frontmatter
  (normative per CLAUDE.md) — one change at the source, not per-component.
- DESIGN.md prose hardcodes the hexes in many places (the Signal Rule, button
  specs, plate-ladder descriptions); those references and any logo SVGs under
  `web/images/` / `web/public/images/` that bake in the orange need a sweep too.

**Open questions** (resolve in grill)

- "The dark color" is ambiguous — the plate ladder is three cool darks
  (`canvas`/`surface`/`raised`). Does `#2A2312` replace `canvas` (the page floor),
  the whole ladder (re-derive all three), or a specific plate?
- `#2A2312` is a **warm** near-black (yellow/red cast), which breaks DESIGN.md's
  stated "cool near-black chassis" identity. Intended pivot to a warm chassis, or
  should the cool ladder stay and only the signal change?
- `#FFBE0B` is brighter/yellower than `#f6921e` — does the derived ramp
  (`signal-bright`, `signal-deep`, `onsignal`) get recomputed around it? The
  "dark-on-orange ≥7:1" contrast (`onsignal #16100a`) and WCAG-AA bar must be
  re-verified against the new hue.
- Does `#FFBE0B` collide with the **pending-yellow** status hue? The Signal Rule
  forbids signal and pending-yellow trading places — a yellower signal narrows
  that gap.

## 13. Brand the /privacy and /terms pages ✅ DONE

## 14. Public home page — fix Google OAuth branding verification rejection

> **Grill together with task 13.** Both reuse the login page's
> background+logo treatment — a public home page makes it four consumers, so
> the "extract `<BrandBackground>` or duplicate once more" call must be made
> once, for both.

Google rejected the OAuth app's branding verification (the consent-screen
review tracked in issue #203, epic #201): the submitted homepage must be
reachable without login and represent the app. Today there is no such page —
`/` is the authenticated Feed (`web/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`), and
`web/middleware.ts` (`PUBLIC_PATHS = ["/login", "/logout", "/privacy",
"/terms"]`) 307s every logged-out visit to `/login`, which renders only the
`vig_logo_lockup.svg`, one tagline line, and the Telegram login widget
(`web/app/login/page.tsx:70-88`) — it does not explain what VIG does.

**Wanted:** a public, on-brand home page that renders without login, acts as
the face of the project (visuals + brand feel), and explains VIG's purpose —
satisfying Google's homepage requirements so branding verification passes.

**UI**

- **Reuse, don't fork:** the brand treatment already exists on
  `login/page.tsx:56-77` — `layered-waves-log.svg` with the fade-mask/opacity
  treatment plus the `vig_logo_lockup.svg` lockup. Task 13 already asks
  whether to extract this into a shared `<BrandBackground>`; a fourth consumer
  answers it — settle in the joint grill.
- New public route registered in `web/middleware.ts` `PUBLIC_PATHS` (or `/`
  itself goes public — see open question). If `/` changes meaning, the
  sidebar's Feed link and `isActive` special-case for `/`
  (`web/components/sidebar.tsx:27-34,180-184`) are the touchpoints.
- Content must cover Google's branding checklist: what the app does, app
  identity matching the consent screen, and a visible link to `/privacy` (and
  `/terms`) on the same domain (`web/app/privacy/page.tsx`,
  `web/app/terms/page.tsx` already exist and are public).
- DESIGN.md is normative: dark plate ladder, signal orange rationed to the
  single primary CTA (sign in / open console), JetBrains Mono for machine
  facts, WCAG-AA contrast, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored for any hero
  motion.

**Open questions** (resolve in grill)

- Where does the landing live: `/` becomes public (Feed moves to `/feed`, or
  `/` renders landing vs. Feed conditionally on the `vig_session` cookie), or
  a separate path (e.g. `/home`) with that URL submitted to Google as the
  homepage? The middleware matcher and sidebar `isActive('/')` both hinge on
  this.
- How much content is "the face of the project": logo + purpose paragraph +
  legal links + sign-in CTA only, or also a feature overview of the pipelines
  / dashboard screenshots?
- What does a logged-in operator see at the landing URL — auto-forward to the
  Feed, or the landing with an "open console" CTA?
- Does Google's sensitive-scope disclosure (how the app uses Google user
  data / Limited Use statement) need to appear on the homepage itself, or is
  the `/privacy` link sufficient for the branding review?
- Does `/login` itself also gain the purpose copy, or does it stay minimal
  once the landing page exists upstream of it?

## 15. Sidebar links to Terms & Privacy (one row, between GitHub and Sign out) ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #307, #308

## 16. Link pipeline — bare URLs get a native Telegram preview + a Brain Links row

`detect_pipeline` (`src/utils/validators.py:50`) only recognizes short/long/article/repo/document
(`Pipeline = Literal[...]`, `validators.py:8`) — anything else is `"rejected"`, and `_route_url`
(`src/telegram/webhook.py:1348`) sends every rejected URL straight to `_reject_url`
(`webhook.py:1274`): a canned "Unsupported URL" reply, no job, no persistence. Meanwhile the
`links` table (`src/database.py:151`) and `ingest_links` (`src/brain.py:282`) already do exactly
"capture a URL, dedupe by canonical URL, store title/topic" — but today only get fed from
enrichment output, 5 callers all in `src/processors/article.py` and `src/processors/prd.py`,
never from a raw user-pasted link.

**Wanted:** sending a bare URL that isn't a video/article/repo/document gets a native Telegram
link-preview card in reply and a row in the Brain Links table on the dashboard — capture only, no
enrichment job.

**Backend**

- Extend `Pipeline` (`validators.py:8`) with a new value (e.g. `"link"`), or repurpose part of the
  current `"rejected"` tail of `detect_pipeline` (`validators.py:73-100`) — decide which URLs move
  from rejected to accepted (see Open questions).
- New branch in `_route_url` (`webhook.py:1348`) beside `_route_document_url`/`_route_article`/
  `_route_repo` that calls `ingest_links` (`src/brain.py:282`) with a single-item list, then
  replies via `send_message` (`src/telegram/sender.py:101`) with the raw URL as the message text —
  no caller currently sets `disable_web_page_preview`, so Telegram's default native preview card is
  the off-the-shelf behavior here; no custom preview rendering needed.
- `ingest_links` requires `topic` and `source_job_id` (used to look up the source job's URL for the
  Obsidian `.md`, `_get_source_job_info`, `brain.py:423`) — a bare link has neither. Resolve before
  wiring the call (see Open questions).

**UI**

- No new component: `LinksTable` (`web/app/(dashboard)/brain/page.tsx`) and `GET /api/brain/links`
  (`src/api/brain.py`) already render the `links` table as-is. Confirm whatever `topic`/`title`
  Backend resolves for link-only rows doesn't break that table's existing display assumptions.

**Open questions** (resolve in grill)

- Scope: every URL `detect_pipeline` currently rejects, or a narrower class (exclude bare domains,
  search-result URLs, non-http schemes)?
- What populates `ingest_links`'s `topic` and `source_job_id` for a link with no enrichment job —
  empty/placeholder topic, a lightweight job row created just to anchor `source_job_id`, or does
  `ingest_links`/`_build_obsidian_md` get adapted to tolerate a missing source job?
- Precedence: if a pasted URL also matches an allowlisted article domain, does full article
  enrichment still win, or does "just save + preview" only apply when nothing else claims the URL?
- Spam/dedup: does this need the same recent-submission guard other pipelines get
  (`find_recent_job_by_url`), scoped to `links.url` instead of `jobs`?

## 17. Persistent account/status affordance — Google connection state + Telegram identity ✅ DONE — issued #292–#295, merged PR #296

## 18. Job details page — previous/next navigation buttons ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #309

## 19. Delete button for jobs — DB + Telegram message, with confirm/"don't show again", swipe-to-delete on mobile

> Touches the same job-card real estate as task 7's dense-table thinking and task 11's per-URL
> tagging — no shared decision, just adjacent surface area.

Jobs render as cards in two places: `JobCard` (`web/components/job-card.tsx:22-51`, Feed's list
view) and `PreviewCard` (`web/components/feed/preview-card.tsx:53-119`, Feed's grid view via
`PreviewGrid`, `web/components/feed/preview-grid.tsx`), plus the full job details page
(`web/app/(dashboard)/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`). Both card components already carry a
`pointer-events-auto` overlay island for `JobCardTags` (`job-card.tsx:45-47`,
`preview-card.tsx:109-114`) sitting above a full-card `<Link>` overlay (`job-card.tsx:30`,
`preview-card.tsx:75-79`) — the established pattern for "an interactive control on a
whole-card-is-a-link card."

There is **no DELETE endpoint for jobs today** (`src/api/jobs.py` only has
`DELETE /{job_id}/tags/{tag_id}`, line 342-354). The `jobs` table
(`src/database.py:35-92`) has `chat_id` (line 37), `message_id` (line 38, the operator's original
Telegram message) and `bot_message_id` (line 74, the bot's reply) — both are plain `INTEGER`
columns with no Telegram-side deletion ever issued against them. Five child tables cascade on job
delete already (`ON DELETE CASCADE`): `job_thumbnails` (line 99), `job_annotations` (line 220),
`job_tags` (line 227), `space_urls` (line 248), `document_outputs` (line 268) — a `DELETE FROM
jobs WHERE id = ?` is enough on the DB side. `src/telegram/sender.py` has no `deleteMessage` call;
every Bot API call goes through `_post_and_parse` (`sender.py:70-98`), the same helper
`send_message` (`sender.py:101`) uses — a `delete_message(chat_id, message_id)` following that
pattern is the natural way to add it. Auth/ownership for a job lookup already exists via
`get_owned_job` (`src/api/deps.py:7`).

**Wanted:** a delete action reachable from every job instance (Feed row, Feed grid card, job
details page) that removes the job from the DB and deletes its message(s) from the Telegram chat,
gated by a confirm-with-warning that can be dismissed permanently via a "don't show again"
checkbox. Desktop gets a delete control; mobile gets a swipe-left-to-delete gesture instead/in
addition.

**Backend**

- Add `DELETE /api/jobs/{job_id}` to `src/api/jobs.py`, reusing `get_owned_job`
  (`src/api/deps.py:7`) for ownership, then `DELETE FROM jobs WHERE id = ?` (cascades cover the
  five child tables above).
- Add `delete_message(chat_id, message_id)` to `src/telegram/sender.py` following the
  `_post_and_parse` pattern (`sender.py:70-98`, same shape as `send_message`, `sender.py:101`),
  calling it for both `message_id` and `bot_message_id` when present. Telegram's `deleteMessage`
  can fail (message too old, already deleted, etc.) — decide whether that's swallowed (DB delete
  still succeeds) or surfaced.
- **"Don't show again" persistence:** `src/database.py` already has a generic per-chat
  `get_user_setting`/`set_user_setting` (`database.py:1232-1249`, used today for the Brain links
  view and recovery-notification toggle) — reuse that instead of introducing browser
  `localStorage` (grep confirms **no** `localStorage` usage anywhere in `web/` today, so there's no
  existing client-side preference pattern to fork either way).

**UI**

- Desktop: a delete control in the same `pointer-events-auto` overlay slot `JobCardTags` occupies
  on `JobCard`/`PreviewCard`, plus one on the job details page's `JobActionsBar`
  (`page.tsx:223-235`).
- Confirm dialog: the repo's only existing confirm pattern is a bare `window.confirm()`
  (`web/components/sidebar.tsx:290-291`, Google disconnect) — no "don't show again" checkbox
  support in that primitive, so this needs a real dialog (candidate: extend
  `web/components/ExportModal.tsx:38-80`'s focus-trap/Escape pattern rather than forking a new
  one).
- Mobile swipe-left: **no gesture library is installed** (`web/package.json` has no
  framer-motion/react-use-gesture/similar) — this is native touch-event handling (`touchstart`/
  `touchmove`/`touchend`) or a new dependency, not a drop-in.

**Open questions** (resolve in grill)

- Swipe-left reveals what — an inline delete button (still confirmed), or does the swipe itself
  trigger the confirm dialog directly?
- Does "don't show again" skip the dialog for all future job deletes for that chat permanently, or
  is it resettable somewhere (a controls/settings toggle)?
- If `delete_message` fails against Telegram (message already gone, >48h old, etc.), does the DB
  delete proceed anyway, or does the whole operation fail and roll back?
- Any distinction between deleting from the details page (single job, full-page context) vs. a
  card in a list (row disappears from an in-memory list) — does the Feed need an optimistic
  removal + undo, or is a hard confirm-then-gone sufficient?

## 20. Feed — a Docs tab that redirects to the Doc Parser page ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #310
