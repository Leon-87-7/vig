# Launch-to-friends — implementation order

Sequenced plan across two tracks: **export isolation** (epic #201) and the
**invite gate** (epic #253). Goal: open VIG to a handful of LinkedIn friends who
sign in and use it, then reach full per-user export parity.

Decisions are pinned in **ADR-0030** (export gate + OAuth credential model) and
**ADR-0031** (invite-only gate + onboarding).

## Phase 0 — land the foundation (you merge)

1. ~~**#207**~~ — ✅ **merged** (PR #207, squash → `main`). Docs only;
   established ADR-0030, the `Operator` glossary term, and the issue breakdown.
2. ~~**#208**~~ — ✅ **merged** (squash → `main`, auto-closed spec #202).
   **Keystone:** `OPERATOR_CHAT_ID` is the admin identity everything below keys
   on; gate enforced at the API layer and the Drive/Sheets service boundary.
3. ~~**#258**~~ — ✅ **merged** (PR #258). ADR-0031 + this launch order are on
   `main`.
4. ~~**#259**~~ — ✅ **fix merged** (PR #261). Stored XSS via `nodeLabel` in
   `web/components/brain-graph.tsx` is fixed; GitHub issue #259 remains open
   because PR #261 did not include a closing keyword, so close it manually.

## Phase 1 — invite gate (the actual launch gate; depends on #208)

5. **#254** — schema + cutover: `users.email`/`status`, `awaiting_email` CHECK
   migration, operator auto-approve, grandfather existing rows. _Gates 5 & 6._
6. **#255** — bot onboarding + gate: first-contact email capture, pending gate,
   push one-tap approve. _Before #256 — the bot is the primary ingestion door._
7. **#256** — web onboarding + gate: email modal, `/api/*` status gate, pending
   screen.

> **🚀 Launchable after #256.** Invite friends: they sign in, give an email
> once, you tap Approve, they use VIG (Telegram + dashboard). No personal Google
> exports yet — that is Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — export parity ("use VIG exactly as I do"; post-launch, slow lane)

8. **#203** — Google Cloud OAuth app + sensitive-scope verification.
   **Start in parallel with Phase 0** — it is external (Google review,
   days–weeks) and no code, so kicking it off early means it is ready when you
   reach #204. Must not block the launch.
9. **#204** — web "Connect Google" → encrypted per-`chat_id` token → exports to
   their `/vig` folder. First real per-user export.
10. **#205** — Telegram Mini App surface · **#206** — connection lifecycle
    (`invalid_grant`, `/disconnect`, notify-once). Parallel after #204.

## Phase 3 — open decision still owed

11. **Global Brain.** Friends' extracted _links_ still flow into the
    operator-owned brain (the Obsidian sync — ungated by design). Not covered by
    epic #201. Decide the "Brain tiers" (private / community / group) track when
    it matters; independent of everything above.

**Critical path to launch:** ~~#207~~ ✅ → ~~#208~~ ✅ → ~~#258~~ ✅ → #254 → #255 → #256.
**Start #203 in parallel immediately** so parity is not gated on Google later.
~~**Land #259 (XSS) before the first invite**~~ ✅ Fixed in PR #261; close issue
#259 manually.
