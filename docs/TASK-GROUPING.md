# vig — Task grouping for broad-bandwidth grilling

Groups the briefs in `docs/TASK.md` by domain/proximity so related tasks can be
grilled together in one session instead of one at a time. This file is a
reference index only — titles point back at the full briefs in `docs/TASK.md`;
nothing is duplicated here. Re-derive groupings from `docs/TASK.md` if it
changes; this file isn't kept in sync automatically.

---

## Group A — Ingest surfaces & the create-job pipeline core

All three add a new way a URL/repo becomes a job, and all three touch (or
should reuse) the same create-job + enqueue core and `detect_pipeline`/
`Pipeline` classification. Tasks 4 and 9 already carry an explicit
`Grill together` note in `docs/TASK.md`; 16 wasn't cross-referenced there but
sits in the same code path (`_route_url`, `detect_pipeline`) and is worth
settling alongside them.

- ## 4. Dashboard URL submission — a second ingest surface
- ## 9. Offer extracted GitHub repos as a follow-up repo analysis
- ## 16. Link pipeline — bare URLs get a native Telegram preview + a Brain Links row

## Group B — Account, Google export & ownership

Both hinge on per-user Google/Telegram identity and the `chat_id` that owns an
export. Task 5's PR reconciliation determines the ownership model task 4 (Group
A) also depends on — grill B before or alongside A if that ordering matters.

- ## 5. Reconcile the export-isolation PRs (#207, #208) before building on them
- ## 17. Persistent account/status affordance — Google connection state + Telegram identity

## Group C — Brain page: Links table, graph & tagging

Everything here lives on `web/app/(dashboard)/brain/page.tsx` / `src/brain.py`
and touches the same `links` table and `LinksTable` component. Task 3 (already
issued) established the table these build on; its open questions (canonical
URL form) echo into 11.

- ## 3. Extracted-links table in the Brain page ✅ ISSUED TO GITHUB #238
- ## 7. Better navigation for the Brain "Links" table
- ## 8. Controls UI on the Brain search graph
- ## 10. Char-count truncation for the links-table description (ui/ux)
- ## 11. Tags should follow the URL, not the job (many-to-many)

## Group D — Public brand pages & OAuth verification

All three are unauthenticated, public-facing pages driven by the same Google
OAuth branding-verification requirement (issue #203 / epic #201) and the same
login-page brand treatment (`layered-waves-log.svg` + logo lockup). 13 and 14
already carry an explicit `Grill together` note; 15 is the sidebar's entry
point into 13's pages, same domain.

- ## 13. Brand the /privacy and /terms pages
- ## 14. Public home page — fix Google OAuth branding verification rejection
- ## 15. Sidebar links to Terms & Privacy (one row, between GitHub and Sign out)

## Group E — Design system tokens

Standalone — a single source-of-truth change (`web/tailwind.config.ts` +
`DESIGN.md`), but its outcome (new signal/dark hexes) affects the visual
language every other UI-facing group above renders against. Consider grilling
this first if its open questions (warm vs. cool chassis, pending-yellow
collision) would reshape DESIGN.md guidance those groups are told to follow.

- ## 12. Repalette: new signal orange + dark plate tokens

## Group F — App shell / installability

Standalone infra task, no domain overlap with the others.

- ## 6. Make the web app an installable PWA

## Done / issued — reference only, no grilling needed

- ## 1. Segmented tabs line breaks on mobile ✅ DONE
- ## 2. Tag creation modal not responsive ✅ DONE
