## Glossary

| Term                             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Job**                          | A unit of work representing one URL submitted by a user. Lives in the `jobs` table. ID format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XXXX`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Short video**                  | Instagram Reel, TikTok, or YouTube Short — processed via `processors/short_video.py`. Transcript via sidecar, then Gemini text enrichment + Brave Search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Long video**                   | Full-length YouTube video — processed via `processors/long_video.py`. Same pipeline as short but with frame extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Content type**                 | Enum: `short` or `long`. Detected at webhook routing time by `validators.detect_pipeline`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Status FSM**                   | Job status lifecycle: `pending → processing → transcript_done → enriching → done` (or `error`/`cancelled`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Enrichment**                   | Gemini text pass that classifies the job: category, topic, objective, action points, tools, market data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Mini-PRD**                     | AI-generated product requirements document derived from a long-video transcript. Two slots: `auto` (no user input) and `intent` (user-supplied direction text).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **PRD auto slot**                | Worker-owned lock (`prd_auto_status='generating'`). Single acquirer — only the worker may set this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **PRD intent slot**              | User-triggered PRD with a direction text up to 1000 chars. Arms a `chat_state` row with a 10-minute `awaiting_intent` window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Task envelope**                | JSON dict pushed to the Redis queue: `{"task": <discriminator>, "job_id": <id>}`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Second Brain**                 | Semantic link graph: every URL extracted from any pipeline is embedded (768-dim via Gemini) and stored in `links` table + uploaded as Obsidian `.md` to Google Drive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Brain ingest**                 | Fire-and-forget `brain.ingest_links(links, topic, source_job_id)` — does not block the user-facing response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Photo pipeline**               | Inline (no DB job, no queue) path for Telegram photo messages. Gemini Vision extracts verbatim-grounded URLs; `_filter_grounded_links` drops hallucinations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Verbatim**                     | The exact phrase Gemini quotes from the image that proves a URL/domain is literally rendered as text (not inferred from a brand name). Required field for photo link extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **UI chrome**                    | Social media interface elements (follower counts, "Followed by X", timestamps) that are not promoted resources. Photo pipeline drops links whose verbatim contains "followed by".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Transcript service**           | Python sidecar (`vig-transcript` container) that downloads videos via yt-dlp and returns transcript text. On caption-less videos, falls back to returning raw audio bytes (base64) for the worker to send to Gemini. Called by short/long processors via HTTP.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Audio fallback**               | When the transcript service finds no VTT caption files, it downloads audio-only via yt-dlp and returns `{"audio_b64": "...", "mime_type": "audio/...", "fallback": "audio"}`. The worker, not the transcript service, sends this to Gemini.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Audio enrichment**             | A single Gemini `generate_content` call that receives inline base64 audio + the enrichment/template prompt. Gemini transcribes and analyzes in one shot. Used only in the template path when captions are unavailable. Preserves the two-call budget (Vision + Audio-Enrichment).                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Repo enrichment**              | Post-processing step in the photo pipeline that fetches GitHub API metadata (stars, forks, last-push date, primary language) for each `github.com` link extracted by Gemini Vision, then sorts the list by stars+forks descending before delivery. Non-GitHub links pass through unenriched.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Enrichment sort**              | The ordering applied after repo enrichment: primary sort key is stars descending, secondary is forks descending. Applied only when enrichment succeeds for at least one repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Repo enrichment fallback**     | If the GitHub API calls fail (network error, rate limit, all 404s), the photo pipeline falls back to the plain extracted list in original order — current behavior, no metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **GitHub token**                 | Personal access token (or GitHub App token) stored as `GITHUB_TOKEN` in settings. Required for repo enrichment — if absent, enrichment is skipped and the plain list is returned. Authenticates REST/GraphQL calls; raises the rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Repo metadata cache**          | Redis keys of the form `github_meta:{owner}/{repo}` storing GitHub API metadata as JSON. TTL: 24 hours. Checked before every API call; a cache hit skips the network round-trip entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Repo enrichment API strategy** | GitHub REST API v3 (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`), one request per repo, all fired concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. Simpler than GraphQL; parallel execution keeps wall time acceptable even on cold cache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Enriched repo line format**    | Four metadata fields per repo: ⭐ star count, 🔀 fork count, 💻 primary language, 📅 human-readable last-push age (e.g. "3 days ago", "8 months ago"). Open-issues count and activity-status labels ([INACTIVE] etc.) are excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Enriched repo description**    | For repos that enrich successfully, the GitHub API `description` field replaces the Gemini-generated label. For repos that fail enrichment (404, timeout), the Gemini label is kept as-is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Repo enrichment scope**        | Only `github.com` URLs are enriched. Non-GitHub links (GitLab, direct sites, social handles) pass through unenriched in original position. Inline filter buttons (language/activity filters via Telegram keyboard) are deferred to a future issue.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Template path fork**           | Caption-based Reels/YouTube follow the text transcript → enrichment path. Caption-less Reels on a template job follow the audio bytes → audio enrichment path. Both paths produce the same enrichment output shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Frame service**                | HTTP endpoint that extracts key frames from a video URL. Used by the long video pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Brain refresh**                | Cron job (Sun + Wed 09:00 UTC) that re-embeds `links` rows whose `updated_at` is stale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Reaper**                       | Boot-time cleanup coroutine(s) run in `worker.loop()`. Three reapers: `prd.reaper()` / `prd.reaper_intent()` reset stuck `generating` PRD locks; `reap_stale_jobs()` resets orphaned `processing`/`enriching` jobs (older than 10 min) to `error`, bumps `attempt`, and notifies the user. None re-queue — recovery is mark-error + manual retry (ADR-0010).                                                                                     |
| **Orphaned job**                 | A job left in `processing` or `enriching` by a worker crash — a consequence of the at-most-once Redis queue (ADR-0002). Recovered at the next worker startup by `reap_stale_jobs()`: reset to `error`, `attempt` incremented, user notified (enrichment → retry button; video → resend link). Never silently re-queued. See ADR-0010.                                                                                                            |
| **Batch mode**                   | Photo pipeline feature: user opens a 5-min window with `/photoBatch-start`, sends N images, closes with `/photoBatch-end`. All images sent to Gemini in one call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Slice**                        | Implementation milestone from the PRD (e.g. "slice #6 = Mini-PRD auto slot"). Slice numbers appear in code comments as a navigation aid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Webhook dispatch table**       | Two module-level dicts in `webhook.py` that map discriminator keys to handler functions: `_CALLBACK_TABLE` (prefix before `:` in callback data → handler) and `_SLASH_TABLE` (command string → handler). Template slash commands are populated into `_SLASH_TABLE` at import time by iterating `PROMPT_TEMPLATES`. The router parses the key, looks up the handler, builds a context object, and calls it — no inline conditionals.              |
| **CallbackCtx**                  | Context dataclass passed to every callback handler: `chat_id`, `job_id` (payload after `:`), `cq_id`, `data` (full raw string). Callback handlers never parse `data` themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **SlashCtx**                     | Context dataclass passed to every slash command handler: `chat_id`, `parts` (split command + args), `message_id`. Does not carry `cq_id` — slash commands have no callback query to acknowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Cancel exemption**             | `/cancel` is the only slash command exempt from the router's pre-clear behavior (clear `chat_state` + delete `pending_template` key). It reads `chat_state` itself before clearing, so it must own the clear internally. All other slash handlers run after the router has already cleared state.                                                                                                                                                |
| **PRD skeleton**                 | Single `run_prd(job, *, lock_col, model, build_prompt)` function in `prd.py` that owns the shared 7-step PRD pipeline: lock acquire → transcript sample → Gemini generate → Drive upload-or-update → Sheets append → brain ingest → Telegram delivery (+ error handling). `run_auto` and `run_intent` are thin wrappers that construct the right arguments and delegate. `PRD_JSON_SCHEMA` is a constant shared by both slots — not a parameter. |
| **GeminiClient**                 | Thin backward-compat wrapper (`src/services/gemini_client.py`) that re-exports the unified `src/services/gemini.py` module. The canonical module owns the single free→paid key fallback loop (`_call_with_fallback`), one `_call_sync`, one `_extract_json`, and four public wrappers: `generate` (text), `call_gemini_vision` (video frames), `call_gemini_photo_links` (photos), `resolve_tool_urls` (URL resolution). Vision and embeddings no longer keep their own loops — see ADR-0011. |
| **GeminiUnavailableError**       | Exception raised from `src/services/gemini._call_with_fallback` when both Gemini keys fail. Canonical for all call paths (text, vision, photo, embed) — supersedes the pre-ADR-0011 split where vision/photo raised `RuntimeError`. Callers translate it into their domain error (e.g. `EnrichmentUnavailableError`) or handle it directly.                                                                                                      |
| **Promise gap**                  | Enrichment output field that identifies the gap between what a video's title/thumbnail promises and what the content actually delivers. Extracted by Gemini during enrichment, persisted in `jobs.promise_gap`, and rendered in the Telegram delivery message.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Prompt template**              | A named enrichment mode (`summary`, `method`, `technical`, etc.) that injects extra instructions into the Gemini prompt and optionally appends a structured `template_analysis` block to the enrichment output. Selected explicitly by the user via a slash command (e.g. `/method <url>`) or auto-detected from the video's title/transcript keywords.                                                                                           |
| **Template auto-routing**        | Automatic template selection at job-creation time: `detect_template` scores the video title + description against each template's `trigger_patterns` and picks the highest-scoring match, defaulting to `summary` on a tie or no match. Users can override with an explicit slash command; a mismatch warning is shown when the explicit choice conflicts with auto-routing.                                                                       |
| **Template analysis**            | A structured JSON sub-object appended by Gemini to the enrichment output for non-`summary` templates (e.g. `steps`/`common_mistakes`/`pro_tips` for `method`). Stored in `jobs.template_analysis` and rendered alongside the standard enrichment fields. `summary` jobs never produce a `template_analysis` block.                                                                                                                               |
| **URL deduplication**            | Per-chat gate that blocks resubmission of a URL whose job is still pending, processing, or done. Bypassed when a template slash command is the active trigger (explicit reprocess intent). The duplicate notice includes a "Show job done" inline button that forwards the original completion message.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Force reprocess**              | `/force <url>` bypasses the dedup gate and resets the existing job row in-place — same job ID, `attempt` incremented, all result fields cleared — before re-enqueuing. Falls back to creating a fresh job only when no prior row exists for that URL in the chat.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Data Flow — Short Video

```
URL arrives → jobs row (pending) → Redis enqueue
→ worker dequeues → short_video.run
  → transcript service (yt-dlp) → transcript text stored in jobs.transcript
  → status = transcript_done → Telegram: ask user to enrich?
  [user confirms] → enrichment.run
    → Gemini text: category, topic, objective, action_points, tools, market_data
    → Drive upload → Sheets append → Telegram delivery
    → fire-and-forget brain.ingest_links
  → status = done
```

## Data Flow — Mini-PRD (intent path)

```
User taps 📐 Build Spec → prd_build_spec callback
→ Telegram: 2-button sub-menu (🤖 auto / ✍️ intent)
[user taps ✍️ intent] → prd_intent_prompt callback
  → set chat_state(chat_id, mode='awaiting_intent', job_id, expires=10m)
  → Telegram: ForceReply prompt
[user types direction text] → webhook text handler
  → validate length (5–1000 chars)
  → store jobs.prd_intent_text
  → clear chat_state
  → enqueue {"task": "prd_intent", "job_id": ...}
→ worker: prd.run_intent
  → atomic lock (prd_intent_status = 'generating')
  → three-window transcript sample
  → Gemini Pro: structured JSON PRD + intent bias
  → Drive upload → Sheets append → Telegram delivery
  → brain.ingest_links (from PRD links section)
  → status = done
```

1. **Worker is the single lock acquirer for both PRD slots.** The webhook never sets `prd_auto_status='generating'` or `prd_intent_status='generating'`. This prevents TOCTOU races between two PRD trigger paths.
2. **Photo pipeline is inline.** No DB job, no Redis queue. Results go directly to Telegram. Brain ingest is fire-and-forget.
3. **Brain ingest never blocks a user-facing response.** Always wrapped in `asyncio.create_task(...)`.
4. **Free→paid Gemini key fallback.** All Gemini call paths (text, vision, photo, embed) share a single fallback loop in `src/services/gemini._call_with_fallback`; keys are read from `settings`, not passed as parameters. Anthropic keys were never in scope. See ADR-0011.
5. **SQLite WAL mode.** The API and worker both open the same SQLite file; WAL allows concurrent readers. Only one writer at a time — the worker owns all write-heavy paths.
6. **Verbatim-grounded photo links only.** Every link returned by `gemini_photo` must include a quoted substring from the image containing the domain. Post-filter in `_filter_grounded_links` drops anything ungrounded or matching UI chrome patterns.
7. **Orphaned jobs are reset to error at startup, never re-queued.** A worker crash leaves a job in `processing`/`enriching`. The boot-time `reap_stale_jobs()` reaper marks it `error`, increments `attempt`, and notifies the user (enrichment → retry button; video → resend link). The video pipeline is not idempotent (re-running re-uploads Drive + re-appends Sheets), so auto re-queue is deliberately avoided (ADR-0010).
