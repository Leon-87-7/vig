| **Job**                          | A unit of work representing one URL submitted by a user. Lives in the `jobs` table. ID format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XXXX`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Short video**                  | Instagram Reel, TikTok, or YouTube Short — processed via `processors/short_video.py`. Transcript via sidecar, then Gemini text enrichment + Brave Search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Long video**                   | Full-length YouTube video — processed via `processors/long_video.py`. Two-phase pipeline: Phase 1 produces a transcript markdown uploaded to Drive; Phase 2 is Gemini enrichment, triggered either by user confirmation (plain-URL jobs) or automatically (explicit-command jobs). Unlike short video, enrichment is a separate queued task, not inline.                                                                                           |
| **Content type**                 | Enum: `short`, `long`, or `article`. Detected at webhook routing time by `validators.detect_pipeline`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Status FSM**                   | Job status lifecycle: `pending → processing → transcript_done → enriching → done` (or `error`/`cancelled`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Enrichment**                   | Gemini text pass that classifies the job: category, topic, objective, action points, tools, market data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Mini-PRD**                     | AI-generated product requirements document derived from a long-video transcript. Two slots: `auto` (no user input) and `intent` (user-supplied direction text).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **PRD auto slot**                | Worker-owned lock (`prd_auto_status='generating'`). Single acquirer — only the worker may set this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **PRD intent slot**              | User-triggered PRD with a direction text up to 1000 chars. Arms a `chat_state` row with a 10-minute `awaiting_intent` window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Task envelope**                | JSON dict pushed to the Redis queue: `{"task": <discriminator>, "job_id": <id>}`. Optional flags: `skip_document: true` (article retry — suppresses the `.md` Telegram document re-send).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Second Brain**                 | Semantic link graph: every URL extracted from any pipeline is embedded (768-dim via Gemini) and stored in `links` table + uploaded as Obsidian `.md` to Google Drive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Brain ingest**                 | Fire-and-forget `brain.ingest_links(links, topic, source_job_id)` — does not block the user-facing response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Photo pipeline**               | Inline (no DB job, no queue) path for Telegram photo messages. Gemini Vision extracts verbatim-grounded URLs; `_filter_grounded_links` drops hallucinations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Verbatim**                     | The exact phrase Gemini quotes from the image that proves a URL/domain is literally rendered as text (not inferred from a brand name). Required field for photo link extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **UI chrome**                    | Social media interface elements (follower counts, "Followed by X", timestamps) that are not promoted resources. Photo pipeline drops links whose verbatim matches any pattern in `_UI_CHROME_PATTERNS` (includes "followed by" and related account-context phrases). Fixed to cover all UI-chrome variants in commit 2df529e (PR #48).                                                                                                           |
| **Transcript service**           | Python sidecar (`vig-transcript` container) that downloads videos via yt-dlp and returns transcript text. On caption-less videos, falls back to returning raw audio bytes (base64) for the worker to send to Gemini. Called by short/long processors via HTTP.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Audio fallback**               | When the transcript service finds no VTT caption files, it downloads audio-only via yt-dlp and returns `{"audio_b64": "...", "mime_type": "audio/...", "fallback": "audio"}`. The worker, not the transcript service, sends this to Gemini.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Audio enrichment**             | A single Gemini `generate_content` call that receives inline base64 audio + the enrichment/template prompt. Gemini transcribes and analyzes in one shot. Used only in the template path when captions are unavailable. Preserves the two-call budget (Vision + Audio-Enrichment).                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Repo enrichment**              | Post-processing step in the photo pipeline that fetches GitHub API metadata (stars, forks, last-push date, primary language) for each `github.com` link extracted by Gemini Vision, then sorts the list by stars+forks descending before delivery. Non-GitHub links pass through unenriched.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Enrichment sort**              | The ordering applied after repo enrichment: primary sort key is stars descending, secondary is forks descending. Applied only when enrichment succeeds for at least one repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Repo enrichment fallback**     | If the GitHub API calls fail (network error, rate limit, all 404s), the photo pipeline falls back to the plain extracted list in original order — current behavior, no metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **GitHub token**                 | Personal access token (or GitHub App token) stored as `GITHUB_TOKEN` in settings. Required for repo enrichment — if absent, enrichment is skipped and the plain list is returned. Authenticates REST/GraphQL calls; raises the rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Repo metadata cache**          | Redis keys of the form `github_meta:{owner}/{repo}` storing GitHub API metadata as JSON. TTL: 24 hours. Checked before every API call; a cache hit skips the network round-trip entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Repo enrichment API strategy** | GitHub REST API v3 (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`), one request per repo, all fired concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. Simpler than GraphQL; parallel execution keeps wall time acceptable even on cold cache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Enriched repo line format**    | Four metadata fields per repo: ⭐ star count, 🔀 fork count, 💻 primary language, 📅 human-readable last-push age (e.g. "3 days ago", "8 months ago"). Open-issues count and activity-status labels ([INACTIVE] etc.) are excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Enriched repo description**    | For repos that enrich successfully, the GitHub API `description` field replaces the Gemini-generated label. For repos that fail enrichment (404, timeout), the Gemini label is kept as-is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Repo enrichment scope**        | Only `github.com` URLs are enriched. Non-GitHub links (GitLab, direct sites, social handles) pass through unenriched in original position. Inline filter buttons (language/activity filters via Telegram keyboard) are deferred to a future issue.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Template path fork**           | Caption-based Reels/YouTube follow the text transcript → enrichment path. Caption-less Reels on a template job follow the audio bytes → audio enrichment path. Both paths produce the same enrichment output shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Frame service**                | HTTP endpoint that extracts key frames from a video URL. Used by the long video pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Brain refresh**                | Cron job (Sun + Wed 09:00 UTC) that re-embeds `links` rows whose `updated_at` is stale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Reaper**                       | Boot-time cleanup coroutine(s) run in `worker.loop()`. Three reapers: `prd.reaper()` / `prd.reaper_intent()` reset stuck `generating` PRD locks; `reap_stale_jobs()` resets orphaned `processing`/`enriching` jobs (older than 10 min) to `error`, bumps `attempt`, and notifies the user. None re-queue — recovery is mark-error + manual retry (ADR-0010).                                                                                     |
| **Orphaned job**                 | A job left in `processing` or `enriching` by a worker crash — a consequence of the at-most-once Redis queue (ADR-0002). Recovered at the next worker startup by `reap_stale_jobs()`: reset to `error`, `attempt` incremented, user notified (enrichment → retry button; video → resend link). Never silently re-queued. See ADR-0010.                                                                                                            |
| **Batch mode**                   | Photo pipeline feature: user opens a 5-min window with `/photoBatch-start`, sends N images, closes with `/photoBatch-end`. All images sent to Gemini in one call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Slice**                        | Implementation milestone from the PRD (e.g. "slice #6 = Mini-PRD auto slot"). Slice numbers appear in code comments as a navigation aid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Webhook dispatch table**       | Two module-level dicts mapping discriminator keys to handler functions. `_CALLBACK_TABLE` (callback-data prefix before `:` → handler) lives in `src/telegram/callbacks.py` next to its `_cb_*` handlers; `webhook.py` delegates the whole callback path via `callbacks.handle_callback`. `_SLASH_TABLE` (command string → handler) lives in `webhook.py` and is assembled at import by merging the webhook-resident commands with each extracted module's command sub-dict (`domain_cmds.DOMAIN_COMMANDS`, `photo.PHOTO_COMMANDS`) plus the template commands generated from `PROMPT_TEMPLATES`. Each extracted module owns its own slash commands. The router parses the key, looks up the handler, builds a context object, and calls it — no inline conditionals. |
| **Dispatch contract module**     | `src/telegram/dispatch.py` — dependency-free module holding the routing contract (`CallbackCtx`, `SlashCtx`, and the handler type aliases). `webhook`, `callbacks`, `domain_cmds`, and `photo` all import the context dataclasses from here; it imports nothing telegram-local. Exists to break the import cycle that would otherwise form when `webhook` imports the extracted command modules while those modules need the `SlashCtx` type. |
| **Telegram sender seam**         | `src/telegram/sender.py` is the single adapter to the Telegram Bot API and the canonical test seam. Modules in the `src/telegram/` package call it module-qualified (`sender.send_message(...)`, not a bare imported name) so tests patch `src.telegram.sender.*` once — independent of which module owns a given handler. Scope is the telegram package only; `worker.py` and the processors keep their `from src.telegram.sender import …` style and their own patch targets. See ADR-0015. |
| **CallbackCtx**                  | Context dataclass (defined in `src/telegram/dispatch.py`) passed to every callback handler: `chat_id`, `job_id` (payload after `:`), `cq_id`, `data` (full raw string). Callback handlers never parse `data` themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **SlashCtx**                     | Context dataclass (defined in `src/telegram/dispatch.py`) passed to every slash command handler: `chat_id`, `parts` (split command + args), `message_id`. Does not carry `cq_id` — slash commands have no callback query to acknowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Cancel exemption**             | `/cancel` is the only slash command exempt from the router's pre-clear behavior (clear `chat_state` + delete `pending_template` key). It reads `chat_state` itself before clearing, so it must own the clear internally. All other slash handlers run after the router has already cleared state.                                                                                                                                                |
| **PRD skeleton**                 | Single `run_prd(job, *, lock_col, model, build_prompt)` function in `prd.py` that owns the shared 7-step PRD pipeline: lock acquire → transcript sample → Gemini generate → Drive upload-or-update → Sheets append → brain ingest → Telegram delivery (+ error handling). `run_auto` and `run_intent` are thin wrappers that construct the right arguments and delegate. `PRD_JSON_SCHEMA` is a constant shared by both slots — not a parameter. |
| **GeminiClient**                 | Thin backward-compat wrapper (`src/services/gemini_client.py`) that re-exports the unified `src/services/gemini.py` module. The canonical module owns the single free→paid key fallback loop (`_call_with_fallback`), one `_call_sync`, one `_extract_json`, and four public wrappers: `generate` (text), `call_gemini_vision` (video frames), `call_gemini_photo_links` (photos), `resolve_tool_urls` (URL resolution). Vision and embeddings no longer keep their own loops — see ADR-0011. |
| **GeminiUnavailableError**       | Exception raised from `src/services/gemini._call_with_fallback` when both Gemini keys fail. Canonical for all call paths (text, vision, photo, embed) — supersedes the pre-ADR-0011 split where vision/photo raised `RuntimeError`. Callers translate it into their domain error (e.g. `EnrichmentUnavailableError`) or handle it directly.                                                                                                      |
| **Promise gap**                  | Enrichment output field that identifies the gap between what a video's title/thumbnail promises and what the content actually delivers. Extracted by Gemini during enrichment, persisted in `jobs.promise_gap`, and rendered in the Telegram delivery message.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Prompt template**              | A named enrichment mode (`summary`, `method`, `technical`, etc.) that injects extra instructions into the Gemini prompt and optionally appends a structured `template_analysis` block to the enrichment output. Selected explicitly by the user via a slash command (e.g. `/method <url>`) or auto-detected from the video's title/transcript keywords.                                                                                           |
| **Template auto-routing**        | Automatic template selection at job-creation time: `detect_template` scores the video title + description against each template's `trigger_patterns` and picks the highest-scoring match, defaulting to `summary` on a tie or no match. Users can override with an explicit slash command; a mismatch warning is shown when the explicit choice conflicts with auto-routing.                                                                       |
| **Template analysis**            | A structured JSON sub-object appended by Gemini to the enrichment output for non-`summary` templates (e.g. `steps`/`common_mistakes`/`pro_tips` for `method`). Stored in `jobs.template_analysis` and rendered alongside the standard enrichment fields. `summary` jobs never produce a `template_analysis` block.                                                                                                                               |
| **URL deduplication**            | Per-chat gate that blocks resubmission of a URL whose job is still pending, processing, or done. Bypassed when a template slash command is the active trigger (explicit reprocess intent). The duplicate notice includes a "Show job done" inline button that forwards the original completion message.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Force reprocess**              | `/force <url>` bypasses the dedup gate and resets the existing job row in-place — same job ID, `attempt` incremented, all result fields cleared — before re-enqueuing. Falls back to creating a fresh job only when no prior row exists for that URL in the chat.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Ignored domain**               | A user-managed per-chat blocklist stored in the `ignored_domains` SQLite table. Added via `/ignore <domain\|URL>` (space-separated, one or more per call), removed via `/unignore`, listed via `/ignore_list`. `github.com` is protected and cannot be added. The short pipeline's `filter_vision_links` receives the list as `extra_ignored` and drops matching links before Brave enrichment.                                                   |
| **Enrichment confirmation gate** | Inline keyboard sent to the user after a long-video transcript is ready, offering "👎 No Thanks / ✨ Run Gemini / 📐 Build Spec". Present only for plain-URL long-video jobs (`template_detection_method != "explicit_command"`). Skipped entirely when the job was submitted via a template slash command — the worker auto-enqueues the enrichment task without asking. Tapping "✨ Run Gemini" now opens the **template picker keyboard** instead of immediately enqueuing enrichment. |
| **Template picker keyboard**     | Sub-keyboard shown after the user taps "✨ Run Gemini" in the enrichment confirmation gate. Presents all five prompt templates (summary, method, technical, review, narrative) plus "✍️ Freestyle" as inline buttons (3×2 layout). After the user picks any option the keyboard collapses to "You chose {template}" and the chosen analysis is enqueued. Picking "✍️ Freestyle" arms an `awaiting_freestyle` chat state instead of immediately enqueuing. |
| **Freestyle prompt**             | A user-supplied Gemini instruction that replaces the standard template's `extra_instructions`. The user types any free-form text; the enrichment worker substitutes it in place of the template's structured extraction instructions. Available in both pipelines: as a button inside the **template picker keyboard** (long video) and as a `/freestyle <url>` slash command (both pipelines). Short video requires a transcript; the transcript is fetched on demand when the user confirms. |
| **Awaiting freestyle**           | `chat_state` mode (`mode='awaiting_freestyle'`) armed when the user selects "✍️ Freestyle" from the template picker keyboard. Same `force_reply` + 10-minute expiry pattern as `awaiting_intent`. The user's reply text becomes the freestyle prompt, stored in `jobs.freestyle_prompt`, then the enrichment task is enqueued. |
| **`/find` command**              | Semantic search over the Second Brain. Embeds the query via Gemini, runs cosine similarity against all `links` rows, returns up to 5 results with score ≥ 0.58. Display: bold title, tappable full URL path (netloc + path, no scheme), topic truncated to 70 chars. GitHub links are enriched on the fly via `enrich_github_links` (Redis-cached) and show ⭐ stars, 🔀 forks, 💻 language, 📅 last-push age and the GitHub description instead of the topic. Photo-sourced links whose topic starts with "The image" / "The screenshot" are labeled "📷 from a photo". Runs via `/find <query>` or plain-text `find <query>` (see **plain-text command shortcut**). |
| **Plain-text command shortcut**  | The webhook text handler checks the first word of any non-URL, non-slash message against `_SLASH_TABLE` (step 3 of the message pipeline, after the awaiting-state check). If `"/" + first_word` is a registered key (e.g., `find`, `rebuild-graph`, `ignore`, any template name), the full text is re-dispatched as the corresponding slash command. Runs after the awaiting-state block so in-progress `awaiting_freestyle` / `awaiting_intent` prompts are not intercepted. |
| **Article pipeline**             | Third URL pipeline alongside short and long video. Routes non-video URLs whose domain is on the article allowlist through Jina Reader → Gemini text enrichment. Single worker task (`"article"`), single processor (`processors/article.py`). No Drive upload. Delivers the article markdown as a `<title>.md` Telegram document, then the enrichment text + a `✍️ Freestyle` button. Supports `/freestyle <url>` and `/force <url>`; no template picker (Freestyle-only — see [[freestyle-only-templates]] decision in the article-url-feature postgrill). |
| **Article URL**                  | `content_type='article'` value in the `jobs` table; third value alongside `short` and `long`. Detected by `validators.detect_pipeline` when the URL's domain matches the article allowlist. |
| **Article allowlist**            | Domain gate for the article pipeline. Two tiers: a hardcoded set of popular dev-reading platforms (Substack, Medium, dev.to, Ghost, Hashnode, etc.) baked into `validators.py`, plus a per-chat `allowed_domains` SQLite table managed by the user. A URL is article-eligible iff its hostname matches either tier. |
| **`/allowlist`**                 | Per-chat command pair mirroring `/ignore`: `/allowlist <domain\|URL>` adds, `/unallowlist` removes, `/allowlist_list` shows the chat's custom allowlist. The hardcoded defaults are not surfaced via these commands. Same URL normalization as `/ignore` (strip to hostname, lowercase, drop `www.`). |
| **Jina Reader**                  | External service at `https://r.jina.ai/<url>` that returns clean markdown for any URL. Used by the article pipeline as the markdown source; replaces the role yt-dlp plays for video. Free public endpoint, optional `Authorization: Bearer <JINA_API_KEY>` header for higher quota. No SLA — outages surface as job errors. |
| **Markdown cache**               | SQLite table `markdown_cache(url TEXT PRIMARY KEY, content TEXT, fetched_at TIMESTAMP)`. Written by the article pipeline on Jina fetch and by `/download_md` on first hit. No TTL — articles are effectively immutable, and `/force <url>` is the explicit invalidation path. Lookups skip Jina entirely on cache hit. |
| **`/download_md`**                | Standalone utility slash command (`/download_md <URL>`). Works on any URL — no allowlist check, no `jobs` row created. Fetches via Jina (or markdown cache on hit), sends the markdown as a `<title>.md` Telegram document. Spam-safe because cache hits avoid the network round-trip. |
| **Paywall heuristic**            | Run after Jina returns, before the Gemini call. Triggers when (a) the stripped markdown body is < 500 chars, or (b) the body contains any phrase from `_PAYWALL_PHRASES` (`subscribe to continue`, `member-only`, etc.). Triggering prepends a `⚠️ Article may be paywalled — analysis may be shallow` line to the Telegram delivery but does NOT abort enrichment. |
| **Article Analysis sheet**       | Tab in the consolidated Google Spreadsheet. Columns: `job_id, url, domain, title, topic, objective, action_points, tools, promise_gap, submitted_at, status`. Written by `sheets.append_article_row`. |
| **Consolidated spreadsheet**     | Single `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` Google Sheet holding four tabs today — `YouTube Transcript Index`, `Short Video Analysis`, `Article Analysis`, `mini PRD` — gaining a fifth tab `Repo Analysis` when the [[repo pipeline]] ships. Supersedes the three separate `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID_SHORT` / `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID_LONG` / `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID_PRD` env vars. `_append_sync` takes a `tab_name` parameter and writes to `"<tab_name>!A1"`. See ADR-0013. |
| **`/force` (extended)**          | Beyond resetting an existing `jobs` row (its original behavior), `/force <URL>` also deletes the matching `markdown_cache` row when present (article path) and the matching `github_repo_bundle:` + `github_meta:` Redis keys (repo path). If only the cache row exists (URL was seen only via `/download_md`, never via the article pipeline), `/force` deletes the cache entry and acknowledges; rejects with the original error only when neither a `jobs` row nor a cache row exists. |
| **Repo pipeline**                | Fourth top-level URL pipeline alongside short video, long video, and article. Routes any `github.com/<owner>/<repo>[/...]` URL through `services/github.py` (REST API bundle fetch) → Gemini text analysis → Telegram document + summary. Single worker task (`"repo"`), single processor (`processors/repo.py`). Distinct concept from [[repo enrichment]] (the photo-pipeline post-processor) — that one decorates a list of links; this one is the primary pipeline for a single repo URL. See [[repo-url-feature]]. |
| **Repo URL**                     | `content_type='repo'` value in the `jobs` table; fourth value alongside `short`, `long`, `article`. Detected by `validators.detect_pipeline` when the host is `github.com` AND the path has ≥ 2 non-empty segments AND the first segment is not in the GitHub reserved-path blocklist. Subpaths (`/blob/...`, `/tree/...`, `/issues/...`) normalize to `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` for storage and dedup. |
| **GitHub reserved-path blocklist** | Hardcoded set in `validators.py` of first-path segments that look like `<owner>/<repo>` but are actually GitHub product pages: `features`, `pricing`, `marketplace`, `sponsors`, `topics`, `explore`, `settings`, `notifications`, `codespaces`, `login`, `signup`, `apps`, `orgs`, `about`, `security`, `trending`. A URL whose first segment is in this set rejects from the repo pipeline. |
| **Repo bundle**                  | The JSON payload cached in Redis under `github_repo_bundle:{owner}/{repo}` for the repo pipeline. Contains `metadata`, preprocessed `readme`, recursive `tree`, `manifests` dict, `fetched_at`, and `no_readme` flag. Assembled by `services/github.fetch_repo_bundle` from 4–6 parallel REST calls. TTL 7 days — separate from the existing 24h [[Repo metadata cache]] used by photo enrichment and `/find`. |
| **Repo analysis**                | The structured Gemini output for the repo pipeline. Dual-audience: `for_developers` (project_ideas, when_to_use, avoid_when) and `for_education` (concepts_taught, prerequisites, curriculum_hooks). Plus shared header fields (`title`, `tagline`, `tech_stack`). Education's `curriculum_hooks` is an array of `{concept, file_pointer?, why}` objects. Stored in `jobs.template_analysis` (JSON-blob column, see ADR-0008). `promise_gap` is deliberately skipped — repos don't pitch like videos/articles do. |
| **README preprocessing**         | Sanitization applied to the raw README before sending to Gemini: drop badge-only lines (top-of-README badge soup), strip inline HTML blocks (`<details>`, `<picture>`, `<img>`, `<table>`, etc.), truncate at 50 KB silently. Implemented in `services/github.preprocess_readme`. Reduces tokens without losing signal — badges and embedded HTML eat budget for no analysis value. |
| **User template**                | A DB-backed enrichment template created via the web dashboard (`templates` table, `is_builtin=0`). Distinct from a [[Prompt template]] (built-in, in-code). **Fires only by explicit trigger** `-name <url>` (dash sigil, vs the immutable `/name` slash sigil of built-ins) — it never participates in [[Template auto-routing]] (`detect_template` scores built-in `trigger_patterns` only). Resolved by an async DB lookup in the webhook text handler at job-creation time; its `extra_instructions` are copied into the job's `freestyle_prompt`, so it rides the existing [[Freestyle prompt]] enrichment seam with no processor change. Built-ins are **not** seeded into the DB — `PROMPT_TEMPLATES` (in-code) stays the single source of truth for `/slash` dispatch and auto-routing; the `/prompts` page reads them read-only. There is no `get_template()` function — template content is resolved by direct `PROMPT_TEMPLATES.get(name).extra_instructions` for built-ins (`enrichment.py`) and by DB lookup for user templates. **Name collisions with built-ins are rejected at creation** (`-method` cannot shadow `/method`), so `jobs.template = "<name>"` resolves to exactly one template. **MVP honors `extra_instructions` only**; `brave_search` and `content_type_scope` are stored-but-unenforced — extensibility is built in via the retained `jobs.template` name, so a later iteration (plus a guided template-builder **wizard** in the dashboard) can re-resolve the row and honor them additively, no migration. See [[web-dashboard]]. |
| **Tenant**                       | The scoping key for all user-owned data — a Telegram `chat_id`, carried on every table (`jobs`, `links`, web tables). A chat_id is one of two kinds: a **private chat** (identity-equivalent to a single Telegram user, where `chat_id == telegram_user_id`) or a **group chat** (a distinct collective tenant shared by many users). The web app currently supports only the private kind: the Telegram Login Widget yields a `telegram_user_id`, which maps 1:1 to its private `chat_id`. Group-chat dashboard access is a separate user type and out of current web-app scope — but the data model needs no change to add it later; only the login→tenant resolution does. See [[web-dashboard]]. |
| **Repo Analysis sheet**          | Fifth tab in the consolidated Google Spreadsheet ([[Consolidated spreadsheet]]). Columns: `job_id, url, owner, repo, title, tagline, tech_stack, stars, forks, language, last_pushed, archived, project_ideas, when_to_use, avoid_when, concepts_taught, prerequisites, curriculum_hooks, submitted_at, status`. Written by `sheets.append_repo_row` / `sheets.update_repo_row`. Array fields serialize newline-joined per cell (matching the article tab pattern). |

## Data Flow — Short Video

```
URL arrives → jobs row (pending) → Redis enqueue
→ worker dequeues → short_video.run
  → frames service → Gemini Vision analysis → links
  → Drive upload → Sheets append → Telegram delivery (photo + links)
  → fire-and-forget brain.ingest_links
  → status = done
  → if template set (slash command): transcript service → Gemini enrichment → Telegram delivery

/freestyle <url> (slash command — works for both short and long URLs)
→ create job row (pending, template=freestyle)
→ arm chat_state(awaiting_freestyle, job_id) → ForceReply: "What should Gemini focus on?"
[user types prompt]
→ store jobs.freestyle_prompt → clear chat_state → enqueue {"task":"video"}
→ same pipeline.run path; enrichment uses freestyle_prompt in place of template extra_instructions
```

## Data Flow — Long Video

```
URL arrives → jobs row (pending) → Redis enqueue
→ worker dequeues → long_video.run   [Phase 1]
  → transcript service (yt-dlp) → transcript + metadata
  → template auto-detect (plain-URL jobs only; explicit-command jobs skip)
  → Drive upload of transcript markdown
  → status = transcript_done → Telegram: send transcript document
  → if explicit_command: worker auto-enqueues {"task":"enrichment"} (no user prompt)
  → if plain URL: Telegram keyboard [No Thanks] [Run Gemini] [Build Spec]
  [user clicks ✨ Run Gemini] → template picker keyboard (5 templates + Freestyle)
    [user picks template] → collapse keyboard to "You chose {template}" → enqueue {"task":"enrichment"}
    [user picks Freestyle] → arm chat_state(awaiting_freestyle) → ForceReply
      [user types prompt] → store jobs.freestyle_prompt → enqueue {"task":"enrichment"}
→ worker dequeues → enrichment.run   [Phase 2]
  → Gemini text enrichment
    → Drive upload → Sheets append → Telegram delivery + "Build Spec" button
    → fire-and-forget brain.ingest_links
  → status = done
```

## Data Flow — Article URL

```
Article URL arrives → detect_pipeline returns "article" (ARTICLE_DEFAULT_DOMAINS or allowed_domains)
→ jobs row (pending, content_type="article") → Redis enqueue {"task":"article"}
→ worker dequeues → article.run
  → markdown_cache lookup: on hit reuse content; on miss call jina.fetch_markdown → insert cache
  → paywall heuristic: body < 500 chars OR _PAYWALL_PHRASES → sets paywall_warning flag
  → send_document(<title>.md) to Telegram
  → _build_article_prompt (+ freestyle_prompt if set)
  → gemini_client.generate(model="gemini-2.5-flash")
    └─ GeminiUnavailableError → update_job_status("error")
                               → send_inline_keyboard(⚠️ message + 🔄 Retry button)
                                 [user taps 🔄 Retry] → article_retry callback
                                   → update_job_status("pending")
                                   → enqueue {"task":"article", "job_id":..., "skip_document":true}
                                   → article.run skips send_document step, retries Gemini only
  → update_job_status("done", ai_topic=..., ai_objective=..., ai_action_points=..., ai_tools=..., promise_gap=...)
  → fire-and-forget sheets.append_article_row (or update_article_row if sheets_row_id set)
  → send_message(enrichment text) + send_inline_keyboard(✍️ Freestyle button)
  → fire-and-forget brain.ingest_links([article_url], topic, source_job_id)
  → status = done

Freestyle re-run:
[user taps ✍️ Freestyle] → arm chat_state(awaiting_freestyle, job_id)
[user types prompt] → store jobs.freestyle_prompt → enqueue {"task":"article"} on SAME job_id
→ article.run reuses markdown_cache → calls Gemini with freestyle_prompt
→ update_article_row (in-place Sheets overwrite via sheets_row_id)
```

## Data Flow — Repo URL

```
Repo URL arrives → detect_pipeline returns "repo" (subpath normalized to github.com/<owner>/<repo>)
→ jobs row (pending, content_type="repo") → Redis enqueue {"task":"repo"}
→ worker dequeues → repo.run
  → github_repo_bundle:{owner}/{repo} cache lookup (Redis, 7d TTL)
    ├─ hit  → reuse cached bundle
    └─ miss → asyncio.gather:
              GET /repos/{o}/{r}                        (metadata)
              GET /repos/{o}/{r}/readme                 (README)
              GET /repos/{o}/{r}/git/trees/{branch}?recursive=1   (tree)
              GET /repos/{o}/{r}/contents/<manifest>   (per detected manifest)
          → assemble bundle → SETEX 7d
  → preprocess README (strip badges, drop inline HTML, truncate to 50KB)
  → flags: archived, no_readme
  → _build_repo_prompt (+ freestyle_prompt if set)
  → gemini_client.generate(model="gemini-2.5-flash", response_schema=REPO_ANALYSIS_SCHEMA)
  → render <owner>-<repo>.md markdown blob → send_document to Telegram
  → update_job_status("done", title, ai_topic=tagline, ai_objective=when_to_use,
                              ai_action_points=project_ideas, ai_tools=tech_stack,
                              template_analysis=<education-section blob>)
  → fire-and-forget sheets.append_repo_row (or update_repo_row if sheets_row_id set)
  → send_message(summary text) + send_inline_keyboard(✍️ Freestyle button)
  → fire-and-forget brain.ingest_links([repo_url], topic=tagline, source_job_id)
  → status = done

Freestyle re-run:
[user taps ✍️ Freestyle] → arm chat_state(awaiting_freestyle, job_id)
[user types prompt] → store jobs.freestyle_prompt → enqueue {"task":"repo"} on SAME job_id
→ repo.run reuses github_repo_bundle cache → calls Gemini with freestyle_prompt
→ update_repo_row (in-place Sheets overwrite via sheets_row_id)

/force <repo-url>
→ DEL github_repo_bundle:{owner}/{repo}
→ DEL github_meta:{owner}/{repo}
→ existing jobs-row reset behavior
```

## Data Flow — Mini-PRD (intent path)

```
User taps 📐 Build Spec → prd_build_spec callback
→ Telegram: 2-button sub-menu (🤖 auto / ✍️ intent)
[user taps ✍️ intent] → prd_intent_prompt callback
  → set chat_state(chat_id, mode='awaiting_intent', job_id, expires=10m)
  → Telegram: ForceReply prompt
[user types direction text] → webhook text handler
  → validate length (5–1000 chars)
  → store jobs.prd_intent_text
  → clear chat_state
  → enqueue {"task": "prd_intent", "job_id": ...}
→ worker: prd.run_intent
  → atomic lock (prd_intent_status = 'generating')
  → three-window transcript sample
  → Gemini Pro: structured JSON PRD + intent bias
  → Drive upload → Sheets append → Telegram delivery
  → brain.ingest_links (from PRD links section)
  → status = done
```

---

## Key Invariants

1. **Worker is the single lock acquirer for both PRD slots.** The webhook never sets `prd_auto_status='generating'` or `prd_intent_status='generating'`. This prevents TOCTOU races between two PRD trigger paths.
2. **Photo pipeline is inline.** No DB job, no Redis queue. Results go directly to Telegram. Brain ingest is fire-and-forget.
3. **Brain ingest never blocks a user-facing response.** Always wrapped in `asyncio.create_task(...)`.
4. **Free→paid Gemini key fallback.** All Gemini call paths (text, vision, photo, embed) share a single fallback loop in `src/services/gemini._call_with_fallback`; keys are read from `settings`, not passed as parameters. Anthropic keys were never in scope. See ADR-0011.
5. **SQLite WAL mode.** The API and worker both open the same SQLite file; WAL allows concurrent readers. Only one writer at a time — the worker owns all write-heavy paths.
6. **Verbatim-grounded photo links only.** Every link returned by `gemini_photo` must include a quoted substring from the image containing the domain. Post-filter in `_filter_grounded_links` drops anything ungrounded or matching UI chrome patterns.
7. **Article pipeline has no Drive upload.** Markdown is sent as a Telegram document only. No `drive_url` is written for article jobs.
8. **Repo pipeline has no Drive upload either.** The `<owner>-<repo>.md` analysis is sent as a Telegram document only. README lives on GitHub; analysis lives in Sheets + Telegram. No `drive_url` is written for repo jobs.
9. **Repo pipeline uses GitHub REST API, never Jina Reader.** See ADR-0014. Article pipeline uses Jina; repo pipeline does not. The two pipelines have different content-fetch services because the source shapes differ (arbitrary web pages vs one well-known platform with native tree/manifest endpoints).
10. **Repo pipeline has no allowlist.** Every `github.com/<owner>/<repo>[/...]` URL routes through automatically; reserved-path blocklist guards GitHub product pages (`/pricing`, `/features`, etc.). The article allowlist exists because "is this an article?" is fuzzy across thousands of hosts — `github.com` has none of that fuzziness.
11. **Repo bundle cache (Redis, 7d TTL) is separate from the photo-pipeline metadata cache (Redis, 24h TTL).** Both keyed by `{owner}/{repo}` but under different namespaces (`github_repo_bundle:` vs `github_meta:`). `/force <repo-url>` deletes both. Photo pipeline and `/find` continue to read only `github_meta:` for fresh star counts.
8. **Orphaned jobs are reset to error at startup, never re-queued.** A worker crash leaves a job in `processing`/`enriching`. The boot-time `reap_stale_jobs()` reaper marks it `error`, increments `attempt`, and notifies the user (enrichment → retry button; video → resend link). The video pipeline is not idempotent (re-running re-uploads Drive + re-appends Sheets), so auto re-queue is deliberately avoided (ADR-0010).
