## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Doc Parser dashboard page (#227, ADR-0029)** — a `/doc-parser` web surface for the document pipeline: file + URL upload, live SSE status, and Gemini-as-transformer output. Closes #217–#226. Trust-boundary logic (SSRF guard, PDF validation, capped remote fetch, capped raw-body read) lives in a dedicated `src/services/pdf_intake.py` deep module with direct unit tests (#228, #229).
- **Brain Links tab + search (#239, #238)** — the Brain page gains a deduplicated, paginated **Links** table surfacing enrichment-discovered links. `GET /api/brain/links` reads the live `links` table (LEFT JOIN jobs, keeps photo-OCR rows that have no job row, newest-first, limit/offset); `list_links(q=...)` does case-insensitive substring matching across url/title/topic. Debounced search input, URLs open in a new tab with `rel="noopener"`. Includes a feed dashboard redesign.
- **Short-pipeline vision titles + clickable links (#211, #212, #213)** — short jobs now harvest a `title` from the existing vision pass (no extra Gemini call) with sidecar fallback, and persist enriched links per job (migration v20) rendered as a clickable "Links Found" detail section. `key_phrases` removed end-to-end (DB column left dormant).
- **Telegram delivery toggle redesign (#233, #231, #232)** — official Telegram brand mark, a `telegram-blue`/`telegram-ring` token pair, a 26px circular toggle, and a hold-to-deliver-retroactively spinner cue that honours `prefers-reduced-motion`. `telegram_delivery` is now a stored DB domain of `{off, on}`.
- **Webhook `/start` + `/help` handlers (#237)** — the bot now responds to `/start` and `/help`.
- **Logout confirmation page (#235)** and dashboard polish — animated segmented content-type tabs, login page design, and signal page-heading icons across dashboard pages.
- **VPS deployment workflow** — GitHub Actions workflow with pre-deploy secret checks, plus docs for moving VPS deployments to prebuilt Docker images via GHCR.

### Changed

- **Consistent mobile page layout (#236)** — unified mobile layout across dashboard pages and broad mobile-responsiveness fixes.
- **Webhook hardened against unhandled errors (#237)** so a single bad update can't crash the handler.

### Fixed

- **`/short_frames` Instagram frames** — `/short_frames` now passes Instagram cookies to yt-dlp so Instagram videos extract frames instead of failing.
- **Brain extracted links ordering (#241)** — extracted links are sorted by latest sighting.
- **Login/logout SVGs blocked by auth (#7723817)** — public assets are excluded from the auth middleware so login/logout artwork loads.
- **Doc Parser deploy fixes** — declare `python-multipart`, copy the web `public/` dir into the image, and surface API errors to the UI.
- **TelegramToggle guarded against failed PUT (#230)** — the toggle no longer desyncs when the PUT request fails.
- **og:image scan no longer aborts on invalid-scheme tags** — `_extract_og_image_url` now `continue`s past `data:`/`javascript:` og:image meta tags instead of returning `None` immediately, so a valid `https://` URL that follows an invalid one is no longer silently dropped (PR #163).
- **og:image scheme validation** — non-http(s) URLs (e.g. `data:` base64 blobs) are now rejected before being stored in `og_image_url`, preventing oversized values from being echoed in every `/api/jobs` response (PR #163).
- **Short-thumbnail backfill memory bound** — `backfill_short_thumbnails._load_candidates` now applies `--limit` at the SQL level (`LIMIT ?`) rather than loading the full table and slicing in Python, matching the article backfill pattern (PR #163).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

The dashboard release: VIG gains a browsable web operator console alongside the
Telegram bot, the article-URL pipeline lands end-to-end, and photo batching
moves to automatic `media_group_id` grouping.

### Added

- **Web dashboard — "The Operator's Console" (#141)** — a new Next.js 14 (App Router) operator UI under `web/`, replacing ad-hoc inspection of the bot's state with a browsable surface. Pages: a **feed** (home) of processed jobs, **brain** (semantic link graph), **spaces** (and `spaces/[id]`), **prompts**, **controls**, a per-job **jobs/[id]** detail view, and a **login** gate. Ships a normative design system (`PRODUCT.md` + `DESIGN.md`): a dark "plate ladder" palette, one rationed signal-orange (`#f6921e`) that always means _act here_, Inter + JetBrains Mono (mono for machine facts — URLs, IDs, scores), two-dialect badges (status filled, type outlined), a global 2px signal focus ring, and a reduced-motion kill-switch (WCAG AA bar). Navigation is a collapsible 64px rail that expands into a slide-in drawer (logo + per-page lucide icons, `aria-expanded`/`aria-current` wiring, closes on Esc/backdrop/navigation).
- **Server-resolved feed thumbnails + content-type tabs (#142–#148, ADR-0025)** — the feed gains per-type tabs (`All` / `short` / `long` / `article` / `repo`); each typed tab renders jobs as a grid of preview cards with images. `/api/jobs` now returns a `thumbnail_url` (+ `thumbnail_kind`: `landscape`/`portrait`/`null`) for every job, computed server-side by a `_resolve_thumbnail(url, content_type)` helper — YouTube long/Shorts and GitHub repos derive a free OG image from the URL, articles scrape `og:image` at ingest, and IG/TikTok shorts persist the pipeline's best frame. The frontend stays dumb: it renders `<img>` or a typed placeholder. A `simple-icons`-backed `PlatformIcon` component classifies each job by URL (YouTube / YouTube Short / Instagram / TikTok / GitHub / article) for card and row chrome. Backfill script `scripts/backfill_article_og_images.py` populates thumbnails for historical article jobs.
- **Frontend test infrastructure** — Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW wired into `web/` (`npm test` / `test:run` / `test:coverage`), with the first suites covering the feed page, job cards, platform-icon classification, the `useFeedData` hook, and extracted job-detail utilities.
- **VIG branding** — logo components and SVG/PNG assets (favicon, app icons, manifest), plus subtle per-page dashboard backgrounds.
- **End-to-end article URL pipeline** (#62) — article URLs (hosts matching `ARTICLE_DEFAULT_DOMAINS` or per-chat `/allowlist`) are now fully processed: `detect_pipeline` returns `"article"` for allowlisted hosts; a new `src/processors/article.py` processor fetches the page via Jina (or reads the `markdown_cache` on repeat), runs a paywall heuristic (`_PAYWALL_PHRASES` + body < 500 chars), delivers a `<title>.md` Telegram document, calls Gemini 2.5 Flash for structured analysis (topic, objective, action points, tools, promise-gap), writes to the new `Article Analysis` Sheets tab, and fire-and-forgets a brain ingest for the article URL. Freestyle re-runs (`✍️ Freestyle` button) reuse the cached markdown, update the Sheets row in-place via the stored `sheets_row_id`, and never call Jina again. `/freestyle <article-url>` and `/force <article-url>` work through existing handlers. Migration v5→v6 expands the `jobs.content_type` CHECK to include `'article'`.

- **`/allowlist` family** (#61) — per-chat article domain allowlist. `/allowlist <domain> [more...]` adds domains (idempotent, multi-arg); `/unallowlist <domain>` removes with a friendly message on miss; `/allowlist_list` shows custom rows only (defaults not surfaced). Plain-text shortcuts supported. `ARTICLE_DEFAULT_DOMAINS` frozenset (15 dev-reading platforms) added to `validators.py`. URL rejection message now includes the hint: "If this is an article you'd like to track, try /allowlist <domain> first." Migration v3→v4 adds `allowed_domains(chat_id, domain, added_at, PRIMARY KEY(chat_id, domain))`.
- **`/download_md <URL>` command** — fetches any URL as clean Markdown via the Jina Reader API (`r.jina.ai`), strips the Jina preamble, and delivers the result as a `.md` Telegram document. Results are cached in the new `markdown_cache` SQLite table; repeated calls for the same URL skip the Jina round-trip. The plain-text shortcut `download_md <url>` is also supported. `JINA_API_KEY` is optional; if set, requests are authenticated with a `Bearer` header.
- **`/force` cache invalidation** — `/force <url>` now also deletes the `markdown_cache` row when present. Three handled states: (1) video job + cache → reset job + clear cache + reprocess; (2) cache-only (no video job) → delete cache + ack; (3) neither → original rejection behaviour.
- **`markdown_cache` DB table** (migration v4→v5) — `(url TEXT PRIMARY KEY, content TEXT NOT NULL, fetched_at TIMESTAMP)`.

- **Explicit-command auto-enrichment** — long-video jobs submitted via a template slash command (`/method <url>` or the two-step `/method` → URL flow) no longer show the "Run Gemini analysis?" confirmation keyboard. The worker detects `template_detection_method == "explicit_command"` after Phase 1 completes and auto-enqueues the enrichment task if the job reached `transcript_done`. The confirmation gate is preserved for plain-URL long-video jobs.

### Changed

- **Photo batches use `media_group_id` debounce, not explicit commands (#137, ADR-0024)** — removed `/photoBatch-start` / `/photoBatch-end` and all supporting helpers. The webhook now branches on Telegram's `message.media_group_id`: `_accumulate_media_group` rpushes each photo to Redis behind a 1-second asyncio debounce, then `_process_media_group` downloads the whole group, runs it through `call_gemini_photo_links`, and sends one unified result. A `_BATCH_TASKS` registry is popped under `try/finally` so a failed group can't leak its debounce task.
- **Photo replies drop the redundant Quick Links footer (#136)** — `build_enriched_links_message` no longer appends a separate Quick Links section.
- **Sheets workbook consolidated into one ID with named tabs (#59)** — replaced `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID_SHORT` / `_LONG` / `_PRD` env vars with a single `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID`. `_append_sync` now takes a `tab_name` argument and writes to `"<tab>!A1"` (tab-qualified A1 notation). Tab routing is enforced in code (`src/services/sheets.py`): long → `YouTube Transcript Index`, short → `Short Video Analysis`, PRD → `mini PRD`. The `Article Analysis` tab is reserved for the upcoming article pipeline (#62). See ADR-0013.
- **Long-video status message collapses to one** — the initial "🔊 Analyzing your video..." message now edits in-place to "🍪 Transcript done, now sent to Drive" via `editMessageText` instead of sending a second message, reducing chat noise during processing.
- **Template command reception message** — replaced `"📥 Received with **{template}** template!"` with `"📥 Received\n✨ Kicking off Gemini analysis ({template})"` in both the one-shot (`/method <url>`) and two-step (`/method` → URL) paths to reflect the intent-first UX.

### Fixed

- **Instagram cookies read-only crash** — `transcript_server` now copies Instagram cookies to a writable `tmp_dir` before passing them to yt-dlp; the production `/app/credentials/` mount is read-only and yt-dlp's attempt to write back updated cookies caused `EROFS errno 30`.
- **Transcript error visibility** — replaced opaque `has_error` flag with a warning log containing `error_type` and `error_msg` (first 200 chars) so transcript failures are debuggable from worker logs.
- **Short-pipeline link cleanup** — `filter_vision_links` drops generic root/promo URLs and deduplicates by hostname+first-path-segment (collapses same-org GitHub repos). Brave search now queries by full URL (not just hostname), canonicalizes the result URL to correct Gemini hallucinated typos, and strips HTML tags + decodes entities from title/description fields.
- **Photo link hallucination (#11)** — Gemini was appending `.com` to every brand name/card label visible in screenshots (e.g. `threadcan.com`, `redactai.com`) because the prompt instructed it to "infer full URL from brand name". Rewrote `_PHOTO_PROMPT` to require a verbatim OCR quote (surrounding phrase context, not just the bare domain) for each link, and added `_filter_grounded_links()` post-filter: any URL whose domain doesn't appear literally in `verbatim` (or the summary) is dropped; links whose verbatim phrase matches `\bfollowed by\b` (Instagram/TikTok follower UI chrome) are also dropped. Also updated the monkeypatches in 6 PRD callback tests to target the now-top-level `src.telegram.webhook` bindings.

### Added

- **URL deduplication** — per-chat dedup blocks reprocessing of already-queued or completed jobs; `/force <url>` bypasses the gate. Catches pending/processing jobs too, so back-to-back sends of the same URL within seconds are also blocked. `database.find_recent_job_by_url` excludes only failed/stale rows; dedup is skipped when a template command is active (explicit reprocess intent).
- **`/force` in-place reset** — `/force` now resets the existing job row in-place (same job ID, `attempt` incremented, all result fields cleared) instead of inserting a new row. Falls back to a fresh job only when no prior row exists for the URL in that chat.
- **Show-job-done button** — duplicate-URL notice now includes an inline "Show job done" button; pressing it forwards the original completion message and collapses the keyboard to a "here you go" reply. Completion `bot_message_id` is stored on finished jobs so the forward is always available.
- **yt-dlp subtitle fallback** — `transcript_server` falls back to yt-dlp subtitle extraction when `YouTubeTranscriptApi` is IP-blocked, and catches caption-extraction errors that previously surfaced as raw exception responses.
- **Mini-PRD intent slot** (#7) — long-video PRDs can now be personalized with a user-supplied project direction. Tapping `📐 Build Spec` opens a sub-menu (`🤖 Build auto Spec` / `✍️ Text your intent`); the intent path arms a 10-minute `chat_state` window, prompts via ForceReply, and generates a PRD biased by the user's text using `gemini-2.5-pro`.
- **`/spec <suffix> [intent…]` command** — recovery path that works without buttons. Per-chat, suffix-matched on the last 4 chars of a job ID, most-recent-wins on collision. Bare form triggers the auto slot; with trailing text triggers the intent slot. Rejects short-video suffixes with a helpful message and falls back to a "last 5 jobs in this chat" listing on no-match.
- **`/cancel` command** — clears any armed `chat_state` row and tells the user whether anything was actually canceled.
- **Cached PRD re-delivery** — tapping `📐 Build Spec` on a job whose PRD already exists re-renders from the cached JSON and updates the existing Drive file in place (no duplicate uploads, stable webViewLink). New worker task `prd_auto_resend` handles the cached path.
- **Cooldown gate on intent slot** — atomic UPDATE-based lock with a configurable `PRD_INTENT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (default 15) prevents accidental spam from double-taps or typo-corrections.
- **Retry buttons on PRD failures** — Gemini exhaustion, JSON parse failures, Drive errors, and Sheets failures now surface as user-visible messages with `🔄 Retry` (auto) or `🔄 Retry Same Intent` + `✍️ New Intent` (intent) inline buttons.
- **In-place Drive updates** — `drive.update_file(file_id, content)` lets the PRD pipeline update the same Drive document across regenerations instead of creating new files. One Drive file per `(job_id, slot)` pair, forever.
- **ForceReply helper** — `sender.send_force_reply(chat_id, text)` for interactive prompts.
- **Boot-time intent reaper** — `reaper_intent()` clears stuck `prd_intent_status='generating'` rows older than 10 minutes, mirroring the auto-slot reaper.
- **Structured logging for intent flow** — new event keys: `prd.intent.enqueued`, `prd.chat_state.{armed,consumed,expired_or_missed,canceled_by_url,replaced_other_job}`, `prd.spec.{matched,no_match,short_video_rejected}`, `prd.intent.{too_short,too_long}`, `prd.cooldown_blocked`, `prd.drive.updated`. **`intent_text` is never logged** — only `intent_text_len`.

### Changed

- **HTML parse mode for Telegram messages** — replaced Markdown V1 escaping with HTML escaping (`_escape_html` / `_escape_attr`) so unbalanced `_` or `*` in AI-generated text no longer triggers Telegram 400 errors. Added UTF-16-aware 4096-char message chunking (`_split_message`); `/find` results and tool links now render as HTML `<a>` tags.
- **Unified template-matching table** — `templates.py` now owns a single keyword table (the deduped union of the old routing phrases and `TEMPLATE_INDICATORS`). `score_template_match` and `validate_template_choice` moved into `templates.py`; `validation.py` is deleted. Adding a keyword now updates both routing and mismatch-warning paths together.
- **PRD generation is now lazy-on-click.** Previously, `enrichment.py` tail-called `prd_auto` for any job categorized as `Technical Tutorial`. That gated too narrowly and generated documents users often never opened. The Technical-Tutorial tail-call is removed; the `📐 Build Spec` button remains the single entry point for all long videos. PRDs run only when the user asks for them.
- **`run_auto` no longer self-delivers.** Telegram document send + summary message moved out of `run_auto`'s body so it can be shared with the resend path and the intent path. On cached re-runs, the pipeline calls `drive.update_file` instead of `drive.upload_file`.
- **`append_prd_row` signature** — adds keyword-only `slot` and `intent_text` arguments (defaults preserve auto-path behavior).
- **`build_prd_markdown` signature** — adds keyword-only `intent_text`; when provided, the rendered markdown includes a `**Your direction:** _<text>_` line under the title.
- **Webhook message routing order** — slash commands always run first and clear `chat_state` as a side effect (except `/cancel`, which reads before clearing). In `awaiting_intent` mode, a bare video URL cancels the intent and starts a new job; plain text under 5 chars or over 1000 chars rejects and leaves the state armed; valid text writes `prd_intent_text` to the job row and enqueues `prd_intent`.

### Removed

- **Technical-Tutorial tail-call** in `enrichment.py` (replaced by lazy-on-click — see Changed).

## [0.1.0-pre] - 2026-05-20

The pre-release baseline: bot accepts Telegram URLs, classifies short vs long, runs the short and long pipelines end-to-end, ingests results into Drive + Sheets + the Second Brain, and exposes search / rebuild commands.

### Added

- **Long-video Phase 2: Gemini enrichment** (#4) — second-pass analysis on long-video transcripts using Gemini; URL-resolution prompt extracts canonical links from descriptions for downstream brain ingest.
- **Second Brain module** (#5) — `brain.py` with `ingest`, `search`, `rebuild`, and `refresh` operations. Backed by SQLite + Gemini text embeddings, accumulates a semantic link graph across all processed videos.
- **`/find <query>` and `/rebuild` slash commands** (#5) — Telegram-facing search and rebuild surface for the brain.
- **Mini-PRD auto slot** (#6) — first cut of PRD generation: atomic lock, Gemini Flash, JSON schema, Drive upload to `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_PRD`, Sheets append, brain ingest of `tech_stack` URLs. Originally tail-called from enrichment for `Technical Tutorial` jobs.
- **Brain backfill job** (#8) — one-shot reprocessor that re-ingests historical jobs into the brain after schema or pipeline changes.
- **Photo OCR pipeline** (#9) — `/photoBatch-start` / `/photoBatch-end` commands accept image batches, run OCR, and feed extracted text into the brain alongside video transcripts.
- **PRD §15 — Photo Link Extraction** documentation block.
- **Containerized transcript sidecar** — moved the Whisper transcript service into `docker-compose` for consistent local + production runtimes.

### Changed

- **Migrated from deprecated `google-generativeai` SDK to `google-genai`** — required for continued Gemini access; touches all callsites in enrichment, brain, and PRD processors.
- **Drive + Sheets authentication switched from service-account JSON to OAuth** for personal Google accounts, removing the service-account-share friction during local development.
- **Job status `complete` renamed to `done`** throughout DB, code, and tests for consistency with the chat_state lifecycle vocabulary.
- **Hardened `docker-compose` service startup ordering** so workers don't race Redis on cold boot.

### Fixed

- **Short-pipeline Sheets column order** — three columns were misaligned with the sheet header, dropping `chat_id` and `video_url` into the wrong fields.
- **Webhook missed `callback_query` updates** because `allowed_updates` didn't list it; inline-keyboard taps were silently ignored on fresh webhook installs.

### Chore

- `.dockerignore` added to keep `.env`, local `data/`, and `docs/` out of built images.
