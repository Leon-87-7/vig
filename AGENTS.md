# Shared agent knowledge

Project-specific skills live in `agent-knowledge/`. Rules are in
`.claude/rules/` and commands in `.claude/commands/`.

## Skill discovery

When a task matches one of the skill folders in `agent-knowledge/`, read that skill’s `SKILL.md` first.

A skill folder should follow this shape:

```txt
agent-knowledge/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md
    reference.md
    heuristics.md
    examples.md
```
